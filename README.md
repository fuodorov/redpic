## Overview

This RED code has been developed since 2020 at the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics as an alternative to ASTRA, WARP, and other codes. For particle dynamics simulation using finite difference scheme relativistic.

In order to use the REDPIC code correctly, it is **important to read the [Know-How](notebooks).**

## Algorithm

The algorithm reduces to lowering the order of the Relativistic Difference Scheme.

## Language

REDPIC completely written in Python.

## Installation

In order to quickly install all the required [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) libraries in the new environment, just download [requirements](requirements.txt) and run the command on the command line:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
