Relativistic Difference Scheme Particles-In-Cell (REDPIC)

This PIC code has been developed since 2022 as an alternative to
`ASTRA <https://www.desy.de/~mpyflo/>`_,
`WARP <https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/warp/>`_,
`XTRACK <https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
and other codes.

For particle dynamics simulation using finite difference scheme relativistic.

Contents of the documentation
-----------------------------

If you are new to REDPIC, we **strongly recommend** that you read the
section :doc:`notebooks/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb` first, so as to have a basic understanding of
what the code does.

You can then see the section :doc:`install/installation` and
:doc:`notebooks/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb`, to get started with using REDPIC.
