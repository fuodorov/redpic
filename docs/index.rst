REDPIC documentation
======================================================

Relativistic Difference Scheme Particles-In-Cell (REDPIC)

This PIC code has been developed since 2022 as an alternative to
`ASTRA <https://www.desy.de/~mpyflo/>`_,
`WARP <https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/warp/>`_,
`XTRACK <https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
and other codes.

For particle dynamics simulation using finite difference scheme relativistic.


Tutorial
