Installation
==================================

Installing REDPIC
----------------------------------

The installation requires the `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__.

**Installation steps**:

-  Install ``redpic``

   ::

       pip install redpic

   Alternatively, instead of using ``pip``, you can also install KENV
   from the sources, by cloning the `code from Github <https://github.com/fuodorov/redpic>`_, and typing ``python setup.py install``.


-  **Optional:** To be able to run interactive simulations, write text and mathematical formulas at the same time, install the optional package ``jupyterlab``:

   ::

       pip install jupyterlab


-  **Optional:** We recommend installing all additional packages from the `requirements <https://github.com/fuodorov/redpic/blob/master/requirements.txt>`_:

   ::

       pip install -r requirements.txt
